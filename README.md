This project predicts heart disease risk using the UCI dataset. It cleans missing data, performs EDA, encodes features, and trains Logistic Regression &amp; Decision Tree models. Evaluation includes accuracy, ROC curves, confusion matrices, and top features impacting predictions.

**Task Objective:** Predict risk of heart disease based on patient health data.

**Dataset Used:** UCI Heart Disease dataset (`heart_disease_uci.csv`, 920 records, 16 features).

**Models Applied:** Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Classifier.

**Key Results & Findings:**

* Logistic Regression — Accuracy: 84.2%, AUC: 0.933
* Decision Tree — Accuracy: 88.6%, AUC: 0.924
* Features like chest pain type, thalassemia, exercise-induced angina, and ST depression strongly influence predictions.
